# Long Assignment #1

> The Caeser cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is replaced with a letter that is with distance *n* from the original letter in the alphabet. The distance *n* is the key to the cipher.

The Vigenère cipher is a modified version of the Caeser cipher by using the letters of a repeated keyword to encrypt the plain text.

You are asked to:

1. Write a code to be able to encrypt and decrypt using the Vigenère cipher. However, instead of using the 26 letters of the English language, the user can provide the 26 symbols used in the encryption from a file. For example, the user can use symbols like `#`, `$`, and `&`.

2. Write a code to analyze the ciphertext generated by the Vigenère cipher in the previous step, i.e., you need to implement a symbol frequency analyzer. Pick a long text novel, in the range 200k characters or more, from google and use it as your plaintext. Choose a 3 to 5 character keyword, encrypt the plaintext, and perform the cryptanalysis on the ciphertext to determine the key length and the keyword.

Show all your steps in performing the cryptanalysis.
